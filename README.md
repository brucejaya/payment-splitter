# Hypersurface Protocol

**Welcome to Hypersurface.**

Hypersurface is a decentralised financial infrastructure for venture investment. The protocol allows entrepreneurs to create and manage tokenised equity, automate compliance and raise venture funding. For investors, Hypersurface provides a platform not just to invest in venture deals and hold crypto equity but to realise unprecedented liquidity on assets that would have previously been immobile, allowing venture shares to be traded like any other crypto asset.

DeFi is finance for the age of the internet, an open global financial system running atop the blockchain. DeFi offers the first radical alternative to the disconnected, opaque, decades-old practices and infrastructure of traditional finance. Having grown from a relative backwater into a thriving $140 billion industry almost overnight, the community today is at the centre of a technical revolution that will subsume the entire financial sector. But what about the other $27 trillion in capital markets? DeFi has survived up until now by avoiding regulated assets but for the space to evolve a new type of protocol must emerge.

The collision between regulated assets and permissionless protocols presents a unique set of challenges, both technical, ethical, and regulatory. Current solutions to building compliant services on blockchain reintroduce middlemen who extract value from the users and prevent the space from evolving. Intermediaries compete and scale like traditional businesses, constraining the growth potential of the space based on their internal procedures (e.g., marketing, hiring, due diligence, etc). If the growth of regulated assets in decentralised finance is dependent on intermediaries, it seems doubtful they will ever see wider adoption.
What is Hypersurface

Hypersurface is a digital equity infrastructure for venture investment. Our mission is to broaden access to the blockchain and allow venture founders and investors to harness its radical potential. We believe that decentralised finance is an opportunity to completely transform the analogue, disconnected and opaque infrastructure of venture investment today. Yet, despite their vast potential the blockchain and DeFi remain arcane and inaccessible to outsiders.

To support registered assets in a way that is flexible, noninvasive, and scalable Hypersurface has created a novel identity system. This model, called Hyperbase, is a portable self-sovereign digital identity that is backwards compatible with EOA wallets, smart contracts and offline signatures. Digital identity model is instrumental in making the compliance process painless, invisible and automatic. By enforcing compliance as a part of the architecture of the market we can shift the burden of law onto code and away from users, creating a truly frictionless experience that allows value to flow freely.

# For founders

For founders, Hypersurface provides a suite of enterprise-grade smart contracts for the issue and transfer of tokenised equity. These contracts will support an organisation throughout its life and serve as a shared public utility for ventures and investors alike. An organisation's profile will act much like an email address or social media profile—a reliable reference point built for a specific utility.

Tokenisation makes it drastically faster, simpler and cheaper for companies to manage shares and raise capital than through traditional means. Instead of needing dedicated support, founders can deploy a set of smart contracts at the price of gas. These hybrid legal contracts enforce rights both on-chain and off-chain bridging the gap between traditional and decentralised finance.

As a platform for programmable value the blockchain opens up a multitude of exciting new use cases, one example of which is on-chain voting. By conducting shareholder votes on-chain it is possible to break the discrepancy between recorded and beneficial shareholders, allowing investors to engage directly in the governance no matter how small their shareholding. This is just one example from a multitude of use cases that would have previously been impractical or impossible. 
		
# For investors

Hypersurface allows investors to engage broadly in on-chain venture investment, trading and governance directly from their smart wallets. We hope to be for tokenised equity what Uniswap and Opensea were for their retrospective ecosystems, pioneers of thriving ecosystems that created value for millions of users. 

Fundamentally, Hypersurface is a control structure. It harnesses trustlessness and governs interactions between users, allowing people to collaborate in ways that would have never been possible. By creating a shared language for describing equity investments we can standardise interactions and massively increase transferability, creating unprecedented liquidity for venture investors.

Illiquidity is the single greatest problem in the venture investment industry. It compounds risk, increases the difficulty of every other process and constrains the market based on the type of opportunity investors can realise an exit on. This liquidity will not only benefit investors but have direct knock-on effects for founders who seek to raise funding and ultimately, broaden the scope of venture investment allowing it to support a more diverse range of opportunities.
